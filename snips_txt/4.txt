2. Question 2
A secure communication network has been compromised and the cyber security team must restore its
security. The network, series, is represented as a series of nodes identified using lowercase English
letters. The nodes must be disconnected in order to remove the threat. In a single operation, any
number of adjacent nodes identified by the same character can be disconnected. Find the minimum
number of operations required to disconnect all the nodes and secure the network.
Example
Suppose n= 5 and series= "aabbaa".
a
a
bb
The minimum number of operations required to delete the entire series is 2.
