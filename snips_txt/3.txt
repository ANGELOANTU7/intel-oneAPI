Sample Explanation 2:
Same numbers as previous example but a different order this time. Here you advise James to shoot 10 and not 11 even
though the latter is the higher value. Bob takes 11 or could choose 2 for some reason. Remember only end markers.
Both ways that allows James to take 20. And finally, marker 2 for Bob. So, you help James get 30 points and Bob get 13.
James is the winner..
If you had chosen 11 say for James at the beginning, Bob would have shot 20 and that leaves 10 for James & 2 for Bob.
Bob would win with 22 points leaving James with 21.
