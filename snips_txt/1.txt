In the finals of the shooting competition, the last two participants going for the gold are James and Bob. Here are the
rules of the competition one last time -
1. The two shooters would take turns to shoot.
2. They shoot at a row of markers (say R markers) which are even in number to make it fair to the two participants.
3. Each marker has a value written on it. Value is say Ni where I is the Marker Index.
4. They can shoot at the end markers only & not in the middle. Else they would be disqualified.
5. The winner is the one with the maximum number of points at the end.
James has won the toss and will shoot first. As always, he is confused on the order to shoot. Your goal is to help James
win the event by guiding him through the order of markers to hit & hence, determine the maximum number of points
he can win.
Input:-
First line is the number of markers, R.
Next R lines contain a marker of value of Ni where i lies within [0,R-1].
Output:-
Number indicating the maximum number of points.
Constraints :-
R lies within [1, 100]
Ni lies within [1, 10^3]
